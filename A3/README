The lower torso segment is the root.
The lower torso segment branches to the legs and the rest of the torso.
The shoulders and head connect to the upper torso segment.

The middle torso segment can pivot.
The biceps and thighs have two degrees of freedom each, controlled by the middle mouse button.

I mostly used the SceneNode hierarchy for the data structure.  Rendering was done by recursive functions with callbacks to A3.  Joints were kept track of by A3 for rotating, though.
